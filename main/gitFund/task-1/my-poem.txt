I am not the fire that never flickers,
I am the coal that stays warm overnight.
The room goes dark, the noise goes quiet,
and still—I hold my heat.

I have learned that breaking
doesn’t always sound like glass.
Sometimes it’s a slow bend,
a door closing without a slam,
a plan folded and put away.

But look—
I wake up anyway.
I lace my boots with hands that shook yesterday.
I speak my name like it still belongs to me.

The world keeps asking for proof,
for polish, for certainty.
All I have is breath,
and the stubborn rhythm of trying again.

That is enough.
It has always been enough.
